# FFVII_combat_simulator
- python terminal game (and pygame version)

## About
- I created a python terminal that is similar to a Final Fantasy VII turn based combat system.
- The player can play against the computer or against another person.

## What I learned
- I learnt a lot about using classes. Each character has unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses.

## Pygame version
- I have created a limited version for pygame
- The player plays as Cloud and fights Sephiroth. I may expand upon it in future but at the moment I want to work on other things.
